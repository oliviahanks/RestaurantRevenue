# Restaurant Revenue

This project was based on the Kaggle competition Restaurant Revenue Predictions. I used the tidymodel package in R to feature engineer and create random forest and XGboost models. I even attempted some stacked models. Check out my best model on Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/code/oliviahanks/restaurant-revenue-project-rf.
